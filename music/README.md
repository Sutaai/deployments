# Music: A gonic & beets definition

This definition is a simple compose file containing configurations for `gonic` and `beets`, two programs used for managing a music library.

Sadly, due to YAML restriction, I cannot publish publicly my beets's config file, because it contains credentials.
I, however, attempted to set a config file as close as what I will deploy, however, this is not the one I am exactly using.
